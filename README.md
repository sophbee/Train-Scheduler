# Train-Scheduler

For this assignment, I used:
- Bootstrap to help with my layout
- Moment JS for formatting times
- Google Fonts
- jQuery/JavaScript
- Firebase to store real time data

I made an application that tracks a train's destination, frequency, arrival times, and how many minutes it was away. When users add a new train to the schedule, they need to provide the when the train starts running that day and how often so the program can calculate the arrival times as well as provide the minutes away column in the scheduler. Then, I used Firebase to push data to the server then retrieved it to print on the client-side.
